## Heading ##
Plus One
## Sub-Heading ##
For anyone looking for a no-strings attached lunch date.
## Summary ##
On days when you want to go out to lunch, but none of your friends are free, let Plus One find you a franger and enjoy an hour of food and good conversation.
## Problem ##
Some people don't like eating lunch by themselves, but love going out to eat. This app allows you to find a partner in crime for an hour, no strings attached, and just enjoy meeting someone new.
## Solution ##
Users can start looking for a lunch date an hour or two before they want to eat, and flip through the profiles of other nearby users who they may want to meet up with. If two users match, a temporary chatroom will be created in order to allow users to formalize their lunch plans.
## Quote from You ##
"I hate going to restaurants alone. I think it's so awkward. Plus I love talking to strangers and hearing their stories. This app is perfect for me!" - Athena Turek
## How to Get Started ##
A user signs up and is verified either through Facebook or sms confirmation. Create a profile, and the next time you want to eat lunch with a new friend, start swiping to see who in your area is free.
